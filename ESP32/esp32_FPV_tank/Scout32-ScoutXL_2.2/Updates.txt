This release offers a few very important key updates.

-Improved Reliability
	The reliability of the signal is greatly improved by changing the channel behavior from
	40mhz channels to 20mhz channels. This results in far less interference.
	A watchdog is also implemented to prevent runaways from signal loss.
	
- Improved Cab
	Cab was slightly thickened at the front to prevent cracks, and a slot was added to 
	allow wiring the ESP32 prior to installation. This makes assembly MUCH easier as
	you can slide the ESP32 AND wiring in and out of the cab with ease.
