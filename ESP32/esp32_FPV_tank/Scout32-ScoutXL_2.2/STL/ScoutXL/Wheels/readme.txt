Idler wheels use 5mmx11mmx4mm ball bearings.
The BearingSpacers are for going in between the ball bearings inside the wheels (optional).

Each idler wheel uses a single Idler-Spacer to space it away from the chassis.
Each Drive wheel uses a single DriveWheel-Spacer to space it away from the chassis.


MySpacer is an extra optional spacer used in front of the wheel to take up space on longer screws.
